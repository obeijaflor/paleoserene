# paleoserene - A blog theme for zola

Paleoserene is a fork of @isunjn's beautiful [serene theme](https://github.com/isunjn/serene)
for [Zola](https://www.getzola.org).  This fork builds off of the old v0.2.0 branch of
the upstream project, as I wished to make some minor changes to meet my needs.

## Preview

This theme is live at https://beijaflor.es.

## Contributing

You likely would prefer to contribute to the [upstream theme](https://github.com/isunjn/serene)
instead.  I am maintaining this fork mostly for my own use.  However, I am still open to
considering pull requests, if for some reason you want to make use of my tweaks too.
